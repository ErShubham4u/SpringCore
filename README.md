# Car Engine Configuration in Spring

This project demonstrates how to configure a `Car` object with different types of engines (Petrol and Diesel) using the Spring Framework's IoC (Inversion of Control) container. It showcases the use of XML-based configuration to manage dependencies.

## Features

- **Dependency Injection**: The `Car` class is configured to use either a `PetrolEngine` or `DieselEngine`.
- **Bean Configuration**: Beans are defined in an XML file for easy management and instantiation.
- **Flexibility**: Easily switch between engine types without modifying the `Car` class.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Apache Maven (for building the project)
- Spring Framework (appropriate version)
